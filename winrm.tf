  This resource depends on instance creation and volume attachment. After both of them are ready, will perform scripts execution on remote instances.
  This block will help upload the scripts to remote instances and execute them.

  Troubleshooting tips:

  To check if winrm is listening:
  curl --header "Content-Type: application/soap+xml;charset=UTF-8" --header "WSMANIDENTIFY: unauthenticated" --insecure https://<ip-address>:5986/wsman --data '&lt;s:Envelope xmlns:s="http://www.w3.org/2003/05/soap-envelope" xmlns:wsmid="http://schemas.dmtf.org/wbem/wsman/identity/1/wsmanidentity.xsd"&gt;&lt;s:Header/&gt;&lt;s:Body&gt;&lt;wsmid:Identify/&gt;&lt;/s:Body&gt;&lt;/s:Envelope&gt;'

  To check winrm with authentication:
  curl --header "Content-Type: application/soap+xml;charset=UTF-8" --insecure https://<ip-address>:5986/wsman --basic  -u opc:password --data '&lt;s:Envelope xmlns:s="http://www.w3.org/2003/05/soap-envelope" xmlns:wsmid="http://schemas.dmtf.org/wbem/wsman/identity/1/wsmanidentity.xsd"&gt;&lt;s:Header/&gt;&lt;s:Body&gt;&lt;wsmid:Identify/&gt;&lt;/s:Body&gt;&lt;/s:Envelope&gt;'

  Using winrm-cli from https://github.com/masterzen/winrm-cli that uses same underlying library that Terraform uses: https://github.com/masterzen/winrm
  ./winrm -hostname <ip-address> -username "opc" -password "password" -https -insecure "ipconfig /all"

  The winrm Go library uses BasicAuth, please refer to the cloudinit.yml to configure winrm with that option otherwise you may get a http response error

  Because runcmd and script are not yet supported via #cloud-config in the above images, one can use #ps1_sysnative to change password and configure winrm with a https listener

  When using your own images:
  You may alternatively prepare your images by configuring winrm using the same commands as listed in cloudinit.yml

  winrm quickconfig
  Enable-PSRemoting

  winrm set winrm/config/client/auth '@{Basic="true"}'
  winrm set winrm/config/service/auth '@{Basic="true"}'
  winrm set winrm/config/service '@{AllowUnencrypted="true"}'
  winrm set winrm/config/winrs '@{MaxMemoryPerShellMB="300"}'
  winrm set winrm/config '@{MaxTimeoutms="1800000"}'

  netsh advfirewall firewall add rule name="WinRM HTTP" protocol=TCP dir=in profile=any localport=5985 remoteip=any localip=any action=allow
  netsh advfirewall firewall add rule name="WinRM HTTPS" protocol=TCP dir=in profile=any localport=5986 remoteip=any localip=any action=allow

  net stop winrm
  sc.exe config winrm start=auto
  net start winrm
